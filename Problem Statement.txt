Write a program:

1. Create a graph of at least 10 nodes and 20 edges. You may use any representation we have discussed

       Print the nodes and the edges.

2. Do a DFS traversal of the graph.  Print the nodes in the order visited.

3. Do a BFS traversal.  Use the same node to start as in 2 above.

4. Also attach the graph.
